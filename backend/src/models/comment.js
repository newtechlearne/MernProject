/*This code defines a Mongoose schema for a Note model and exports it for use in other parts of the application. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

The mongoose package is imported to interact with MongoDB.

The noteSchema variable defines the schema for the Note model using the mongoose.Schema constructor. It specifies the structure and validation rules for the Note documents in the database.

Inside the noteSchema, there are several fields defined:

title: A string field with the type set to String and trim set to true. This field is optional and will automatically remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
content: A string field with the type set to String and trim set to true. This field is required, meaning it must have a value, and will also remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
owner: A field representing the owner of the note. It uses the mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId type, which refers to the unique identifier of another document in the database. It is required and references the "User" model.
Additional options are provided as the second argument to the mongoose.Schema constructor:

timestamps: true: This option automatically adds createdAt and updatedAt fields to the documents, storing the creation and last update timestamps, respectively.
toJSON: { virtuals: true }: This option ensures that virtual properties defined on the schema will be included when the document is converted to JSON.
The Note model is created using mongoose.model(), which takes two arguments:

The first argument is the model name, which in this case is "Note".
The second argument is the schema (noteSchema) that defines the structure and behavior of the model.
Finally, the Note model is exported from the module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

This code sets up the Note model in Mongoose, defining the schema and exporting the model for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Note documents in the MongoDB database.*/
