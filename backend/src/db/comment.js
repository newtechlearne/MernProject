/*In this code snippet, the mongoose package is being used to connect to a MongoDB database using the connection URL stored in the environment variable NOTER_MONGODB_URL. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

The mongoose package is imported into the script to enable interaction with MongoDB.

The dbconnecturl variable is assigned the value of the NOTER_MONGODB_URL environment variable using process.env.NOTER_MONGODB_URL. This allows the script to access the database connection URL specified in the environment.

The mongoose.connect() method is called to establish a connection to the MongoDB database. It takes two arguments:

The first argument is the dbconnecturl, which is the connection URL for the MongoDB database.
The second argument is an options object that configures the behavior of the MongoDB driver. In this case, useNewUrlParser: true and useUnifiedTopology: true are set to ensure that the latest connection string parser and unified topology are used, respectively.
By utilizing mongoose.connect() with the provided connection URL and options, the script establishes a connection to the MongoDB database specified in the environment variable.*/
